## How to Contribute Ideas

Got an idea? We'd love to hear it!

1. Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Prawal-Sharma/Recoverly)
2. Use the "Feature Request" template
3. Describe who it helps and how
4. No idea is too wild!

## Priority Considerations

When evaluating new features, we ask:
1. Does it help people in recovery?
2. Is it accessible to everyone?
3. Does it respect privacy?
4. Is it evidence-based?
5. Can we maintain it long-term?

## Remember

These are just ideas! The platform already helps thousands of people as-is. Any future additions will be carefully considered to ensure they truly serve the recovery community.

**The best feature is the one that helps someone stay sober today.**
